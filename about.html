        <h2>Bio</h2>
		<p>
            Hi, I am Pratik Mangtani, a product developer and designer, who takes an interdisciplinary approach to design. I have a background in computer engineering. I plan to advance my self-taught journey in design by designing solutions that use information to empower people.
        </p>

        <h2>My background</h2>
        <p>
            My goal is to bring empathy to technology. My background in Computer Science enables me to bring a technical point of view to design in addition to advocating for users' needs.
            To fulfill these goals, I contribute to both product development and UX design through my work.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>How the culinary arts made me a better designer</h2>
        <p>
            Apart from technology, I am passionate about the culinary arts.
            My desire to design technology that enhances usersâ€™ experience stems from my background in the culinary arts and computer engineering. Culinary arts and Human-Computer Interaction both work towards the common goal of creating a stimulating experience for people. Just like I arduously plan ingredients to create dishes, I break down problems and tailor individual modules to curate effective solutions for customers.
            This led me to discover the union of my technical and creative skills through HCI.
        </p>
        <br>
